		<h3>Bio</h3>
		<p>I recieved my B.S in Psychology and Computer Science from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2014. I am currently a M.S. student in computer science at New York University's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, set to graduate in May 2016. My primary interest is in natural language processing (NLP). More broadly I am interested in artificial intelligence, machine learning, cognitive psychology and startup companies.</p>
		<p>I currently work as a web developer for the healthcare startup for[MD]. I've previously worked in the Language, Cognition and Brain Lab under Dr. Peter Gordon and at Metabolon, a biochemical company.</p>
		<p>On the less professional side... I enjoy winter sports, particularly ice hockey and snowboarding. I'm a big fan of NPR and KNRK 94.7FM from Portland, Ore. I also enjoy playing and composing music, though the quality of my work in that area is variable.</p>

		<h3>Public Projects</h3>
		<p>Here's a list of projects I've done. Those that are publicly available you can also find on my GitHub. Most of them are projects I've picked up along my academic career but some are also personal pet projects! No work projects since those are confidential. </p>
